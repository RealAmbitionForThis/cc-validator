 A Credit Card Validator Using The Luhn Algorithm for school

# What Is The Luhn Algorithm?
 The Luhn method is a simple checksum formula that is used to validate a wide range of identifying numbers, including credit card numbers. It was created to guard against unintentional errors rather than malicious attacks. The algorithm is used by most credit cards and many government identity numbers to differentiate authentic numbers from mistyped or otherwise inaccurate numbers.
